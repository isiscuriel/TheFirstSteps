<h1> How To Cope </h1>

<li>Try to make new friends. Healthy relationships with peers are central 
to teens’ self-esteem and provide an important social outlet.</li>
<li>Participate in sports, job, school activities or hobbies. Staying busy 
helps teens focus on positive activities rather than negative feelings or 
behaviors.</li>
<li>Join organizations that offer programs for young people. Special 
programs geared to the needs of adolescents help develop additional 
interests.</li>
<li>Ask a trusted adult for help. When problems are too much to handle 
alone, teens should not be afraid to ask for help.</li>
<li>Develop a dependable support system of friends, family and campus 
professionals.</li>
<li>Try to establish and maintain consistent sleep habits, avoiding 
disruptions such as all-night study sessions.</li>
<li>Get plenty of regular exercise.</li>
<li>Eat a healthy diet.</li>
<li>Avoid using alcohol or drugs.</li>
<li>Keep stress in check. Seek academic help when needed, and don’t 
hesitate to seek guidance for roommate, relationship or financial concerns.</li>
<li>If you have been receiving treatment back home, make it a priority to make 
referral arrangements with a healthcare provider and pharmacy near campus before 
school starts.
